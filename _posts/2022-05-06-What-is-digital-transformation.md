Digital Transformation is not a revolution, it is an evolution. It is an ongoing transformation journey with digital technologies as catalysts that affect all aspects of life.

How did the digital transformation affect my daily life?   
In multiple ways. Some examples:
* I enjoy my morning coffee with my tablet at hand and the latest news on screen. The physical newspaper in front of the door and next to the breakfast plate is gone.
* I listen to music streamed via Spotify. The physical CD is gone.
* I order the majority of the household stuff, clothes, shoes etc online with in-house delivery. Shopping in stores is kept to a minimum.
* I am booking all my hotels and travels online. I did not visit a travel agency since years.
* A physical bookshelf? I don’t own one. All books are read on screen and stored in my e-library.
* …

—> Digital technologies have not just had a huge impact on daily activities, they have profoundly transformed the way I live, work, communicate, consume media, read books, do my shopping etc. 

How did the digital transformation affect businesses?   
In multiple ways as well, new companies have emerged, business models and processes have changed, but with one common pattern: The digital transformation is not just the implementation of technologies. It goes far beyond the simple implementation, it is the end-to-end transformation of business processes.
