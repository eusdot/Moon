From basic research to plasma business and from there to program management and digital transformation. How does this career trajectory unfold? Why digital transformation? How does it link to biotechnology, my initial study programme? 
Well… Most probably it is not the most straight forward and smoothest career trajectory, but it has definitely been worth going it as it has broadened my mind and enabled a very steep learning curve. Was it planned like that? No! But as so often in life, opportunities come and go and sometimes it just feels right to jump on the moving train. 

Besides of taking opportunities, curiosity coupled with a strong interest on how technology unfolds its impact on society is most probably a trait that has led me where I am today. 

### Step by step
The first step into this direction was to study biotechnology. Not just because it is an interdisciplinary science that uses the study and techniques of many fields like chemistry, engineering, molecular biology, genetics, bioinformatics etc. Also because biotechnology has a huge impact on everyday life as we are heavily surrounded by products made by biotechnology. Everyday products like food and beverages („yellow biotechnology“) and - accepted or not - GMO-products („green biotechnology“), household products („white biotechnology“) and medicines („red biotechnology“) to name a few. Life without biotechnology made products - unbelievable.

In parallel, I realized the potential around digitalization and its impact on simplifying private and professional life. In the beginning it was simple stuff - e-banking, virtual communication, smartphones, paperless office - all at a time when it had not yet become mainstream.

During my PhD I was very much into (molecular) docking to converge wet-lab with dry-lab work and to utilize the docking results to support the experimental outcome as well as the hypothesis formulation.

Right after leaving academia, I got the chance to lead my first digitalization project in the pharmaceutical context. The journey continued and finally resulted in a full-time position around digital transformation. 

### Could I envision to hold another role?

For the time being, no! Working on topics around digital transformation feels like a perfect match for multiple reasons: 
* Staying on top of emerging trends and breaking new grounds is exciting!
* Seeing real-world evidence and the impact on how digitalisation unfolds is fullfilling.
* It is an ongoing learning journey with a steep learning curve.
* It requires technological understanding paired with good understanding on how organizations operate and can be transformed.
* And I strongly believe that the digital transformation has the potential to make life easier, people happier and the environment healthier :-).
