From basic research to plasma business and from there to program management and digital transformation. How does this career trajectory unfold? Why digital transformation? How does it link to biotechnology, my initial study programme? 
Well… Most probably it is not the most straight forward and smoothest career trajectory, but it has definitely been worth going it as it has broadened my mind and enabled a very steep learning curve. Was it planned like that? No! But as so often in life, opportunities come and go and sometimes it just feels right to jump on the moving train. 

Besides of taking opportunities, curiosity coupled with a strong interest on how technology unfolds its impact on society is most probably a trait that has led me where I am today. The first step into this direction was to study biotechnology. Not just because it is an interdisciplinary science that uses the study and techniques of many fields like chemistry, engineering, molecular biology, genetics, bioinformatics etc. Also because biotechnology has a huge impact on everyday life as we are heavily surrounded by products made by biotechnology. Everyday products like food and beverages („yellow biotechnology“) and - accepted or not - GMO-products („green biotechnology“), household products („white biotechnology“) and medicines („red biotechnology“) to name a few. Life without biotechnology made products - unbelievable.

In parallel, I realized the potential around digitalization and its impact on simplifying private and professional life. In the beginning it was simple stuff for mainly private activities - e-banking, virtual communication, smartphones, paperless office - then continued with my first digitalization project in the pharmaceutical context and finally resulted in a full-time position around digital transformation. 

Could I envision to hold another role? For the time being, no! Working on topics around digital transformation feels like a perfect match for multiple reasons: 
* It offers a broad spectrum of activities with an ongoing steep learning curve.
* It requires technological understanding paired with good understanding on how organizations operate and can be transformed.
* And I strongly believe that the digital transformation has the potential to make everyday‘s life easier, people happier and the environment healthier.
