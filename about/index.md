I am a biotechnologist driving the digital transformation and new ways of work within Biopharma R&D. I am building on several years of experience in program management as well as global and cross-functional matrix team leadership within the biopharmaceutical industry. 

## My current and post roles
Currently I am working in a global role as Head of Digital Acceleration at Takeda, R&D, Pharmaceutical Sciences with my main office in Vienna & Orth (Austria). I am leading strategic initiatives and projects to deploy our Digital Transformation strategy. I act as translator by identifying requirements, shaping solutions, driving change, and by speaking the language of technology as well as of business, thereby building the bridge between technology and organization for successful implementation.

Prior to diving into the topic of digital transformation I was leading global drug development and lifecycle programs in virtual settings within a matrix organization with team members spread over Europe, Asia and America. Prior to that I was working on a Viennese based plasma fractionation plant in the team of the plant manager and was assigned to multiple projects and activities around site development, business excellence and production related optimization projects. 

## My education
I hold a PhD in technical sciences and a MSc in biotechnology and look back to five years of academic research with research stays in Norway, Belgium, and Denmark. My research focus was on enzyme technology, protein engineering and carbohydrate chemistry and resulted in several peer-reviewed articles and one patent. 
See my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=4CsfpfwAAAAJ&hl=en) for a full list of publications.

## My working-style
I am very structured and organized with strong analytical skills, a getting-things-done mentality, and a passion for life-long-learning.

## My private life
In my private life I very much enjoy being with my family, especially outdoors, and running. Besides, I have a strong desire for staying at the pulse of time and like reading, especially around the intersection of technology and society, (agile) leadership as well as (geo)politics.
