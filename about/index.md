I am passionate about technology and its impact on how we live, work and lead. I am building on 12 years of international experience in different roles in challenging industrial and academic settings.

## Current and previous roles
I consider myself as generalist always eager to learn and develop, and to explore new territories. Currently I am working in a global role as Head of Digital Acceleration at Takeda, R&D, Pharmaceutical Sciences. I am leading a team of highly skilled engineers to develop and implement innovative digital solutions and the program lead for data and digital projects across the organisation.

Prior to acting within the data and digital space I was leading global drug development and lifecycle programs in virtual settings within a matrix organization with team members spread over Europe, Asia and America. Prior to that I was working on a Viennese based plasma fractionation plant in the team of the plant manager and was assigned to multiple projects and activities around site development, business excellence and production related optimization projects. 

## Background
I hold a PhD in technical sciences and a MSc in biotechnology and look back to five years of academic research with research stays in Norway, Belgium, and Denmark. My research focus was on enzyme technology, protein engineering and carbohydrate chemistry and resulted in several peer-reviewed articles and one patent. 
See my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=4CsfpfwAAAAJ&hl=en) for a full list of publications.

## Working style
I am very structured and organized with strong analytical skills, a getting-things-done mentality, and a passion for life-long-learning.

## Private life
In my private life I very much enjoy being with my family, especially outdoors, and running. Besides, I have a strong desire for staying at the pulse of time and like reading, especially around the intersection of technology and society, leadership in times of change as well as (geo)politics.
